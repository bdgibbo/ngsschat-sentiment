## possible RQs (from ed policy piece)

### ORIGINAL 

Research Question 1: How did the public sentiment toward the NGSS vary, if any, across all states on Twitter?
Research Question 2: What was the topical structure in the NGSS discourse on Twitter?
Research Question 3: Who were the opinion leaders in the NGSS communication network on Twitter?

### ADDITIONAL/MODIFIED

How does sentiment differ between chat and non-chat time?
Do we look at professional role? I think so
How do we look at topical structure? We could do a dictionary-based approach. or we could do topic models

## pre-requisites for analysis

- identifying chats
